# Stream

I want to create some kind of documentation of what I BUILT and LEARNED with my stream.
Document as much as possible

## Plan

- [x] activate DHCP for integrated ethernet on native_sim
  - [x] Check how to use DNS Server reported over DHCP
- [x] create bridge from ethernet over wlan on linux for nucleo

## Follow up

### Another stream

- [ ] activate DHCP for ethernet on nucleo
  - [ ] Check how to use DNS Server reported over DHCP
- [ ] Run unit tests on specific nucleo board
- [ ] start with [[250308-coap-server|coap server]]
- [ ] try to use gpio simulation for native_sim (renode required?)

### After stream

Is there anything you need to take care of after the stream?

## Notes
