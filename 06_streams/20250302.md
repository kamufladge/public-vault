# Stream

I want to create some kind of documentation of what I BUILT and LEARNED with my stream.
Document as much as possible

## Plan

- [x] setup zephyr sdk for simulation
- [x] setup ``nvim-zephyr`` to develop c
- [x] setup simulation with network (ethernet)
- [ ] How to write unit tests for simulation

## Follow up

### Another stream

- [ ] integrate AI in smart watering to detect health status of a plant

### After stream

Is there anything you need to take care of after the stream?

- [x] How to show only part of a window in obs
- [x] How to fix markdown preview in nvim (fix by warp disable)
- [x] How to delete chat messages?
- [x] how to activate virtual env with tmuxinator on startup
- [x] why is my clipboard not working between nvim ``"+y`` and another window to paste:
  !!!Dont change that behaviour because of potential password leaks!!!!
- [x] check if nvim ui shows a copied password in context menu when trying to paste with ``"``
- [x] dap-ui stacktrace jump to file and line, works with **o**
- [x] How to disable warning in markdown lsp? line length
- [x] check how to create color scheme for nvim
- [x] set own ASCII logo nvim startup
- [x] why cant i delete a git repo write protected file?? ``use -f flag on rm``
