# Stream

I want to create some kind of documentation of what I BUILT and LEARNED with my stream.
Document as much as possible

## Plan

- [x] Show answers of the open questions from last stream
- [x] Write unit test with simulation
- [x] find out how to create/use configuration file to build debug
- [x] find out how to use overlay config files to build for target
  - create a boards/BOARD.conf file
  - or create a ``overlay-XXX.conf`` and load it with ``-DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-XXX.conf``
- [x] create overlay file to build for offload sockets
- [x] create overlay file to build with integrated ethernet
  - [x] check if it can be traced with wireshark

## Follow up

- [x] activate DHCP for integrated ethernet on native_sim
  - [x] Check how to use DNS Server reported over DHCP

### Another stream

- [ ] create new application and integrate coap-server
  - [ ] use similar setup of folder structure as sample-application zephyr
- [ ] coap-client in another application
  - [ ] communicate with coap-server both configured integrated ethernet
- [ ] try to run coap server sample on nucleo board without changing code
  (overlay files are ok)
- [ ] Run unit tests on specific nucleo board
- [ ] CI/CD Pipeline for building and testing ``native-sim``, check out sample-application repo from zephyr
- [ ] CI/CD Pipeline for testing on specific ``board``
- [ ] Own board overlay file

### After stream

Is there anything you need to take care of after the stream?
