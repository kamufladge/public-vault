# Stream

I want to create some kind of documentation of what I BUILT and LEARNED with my stream.
Document as much as possible

## Plan

- [x] activate DHCP for ethernet on nucleo
  - [x] Check how to use DNS Server reported over DHCP
- [x] try to use gpio simulation/emulation for native_sim (renode required?)

## Follow up

### Another stream

- [x] Run unit tests on specific nucleo board

### After stream

Is there anything you need to take care of after the stream?

## Notes
